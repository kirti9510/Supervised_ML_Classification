Patients were classified as having or not having heart disease based on cardiac catheterization, the gold standard. If they had more than 50% narrowing of a coronary artery they were labeled as having heart disease.

Its diagnoses is important, which includes analysis of various factors that are present in the dataset used in this project.

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
